CONCEPT

XmgFit is a wrapper for Xmgrace (*) allowing to use comfortable the non-
linear curve fitting capability of Xmgrace from the command line.
Therefore the capabilities are limited by xmgrace. Please refer to the
xmgrace users guide for more details.

It is also handy to incorporate in shell scripts. The -s or --scripty
option returns all result values xmgrace provide in an EVALuable format
to make them easy available in shell scripts.

************************************************************************

INSTALLATION

 0. Requirements:
    
    The script is written to be interpreted with the Bourne shell (sh),
    which is in general available on all Unix/Linux platforms.
    Despite the standard command line tools (cat, tail,...) the only
    dependency is 'Xmgrace' obviously.
    
    
 1. Installation:
    
    Just copy the 'xmgfit' file in a folder which is included in your
    $PATH, or add the folder to the $PATH variable.

									
************************************************************************

USAGE

 0. General:
 
    xmgfit <file> <equation> [options]

    The <file> must be readable and contain the data in a format compatible
    to xmgrace. The <equation> follows the same rules like in the respective
    dialogue of xmgrace, e.g. 'a0+a1*x+a2*x^2'.
    Please consult the xmgrace users guide about the syntax, operators and
    functions.

 0.1. Options:

      -x <col>, --ycol <col>
      -y <col>, --vcol <col>
      Define the number of the column in the input file.
      (default: -x 1 -y 2)

      -p <file>, --png <file>
      Produces as an aditional output a png containing your fit.

      -t <val>, --tolerance <val>
      Tolerance (default: 1e-5)
      
      -n <val>, --iterations <val>
      Number of iterations (default: 20)

      -i, --interactive
      Open xmgrace with the fit for interactive use.

      -s, --scripty
      The usual (xmgrace) output is replaced by an EVALuable string, like:
      '_ChiSq=4944.18;_CorC=0.997348;_RMS=0.122492;...'.
      The whole result set of the fitting procedure is so available in the  
      shell script for further manipulation, see example.sh.

      --vopt 'a#=<init_value>[,<low_bound>,<up_bound>][;a#=...][;...]'
      Set the initial guess and optional restrict variable to a range.

      --xmin <val>, --xmax <val>
      --ymin <val>, --ymax <val>
      Restrict the data points which will be used for the fit to a range.
    
    
 1. Examples:
 
 1.1  A simple fit from the command line:
      
      You have a file containing x,y-data points suitable for xmgrace,
      like e.g. square.dat:
      
              X          Y
      -2.4000e+00 1.0483e+02
      -1.6158e+00 6.6882e+01
      -8.3158e-01 5.9179e+01
      -4.7368e-02 1.0368e+02
       7.3684e-01 8.8400e+01
       1.5211e+00 9.5487e+01
       ...
       
       To fit a polynomial function of 2nd order we type on the shell:
       
       xmgfit square.dat 'a0+a1*x+a2*x^2'
       
       The output will be the as in xmgrace:

       Fitting with formula: y = a0+a1*x+a2*x^2
       Initial guesses:
       	a0 = 1
       	a1 = 1
       	a2 = 1
       Tolerance = 1e-05
       Relative error in the sum of squares is at most tol.
       Computed values:
       	a0 = 63.4911
       	a1 = 4.15215
       	a2 = 3.98625

       Chi-square: 4839.29
       Correlation coefficient: 0.997358
       RMS relative error: 0.129001
       Theil U coefficent: 0.045383
 	 

 1.1  How to integrate fit in a shell script:

      Like shown in example.sh, we can directly evaluate the output of
      xmgfit if we use the -s or --scripty option:

      eval $(./xmgfit linear.dat a0*x+a1 -s)

      The result set is now available by shell variables (_ChiSq, _CorC, 
      _RMS, _TheilU, _a0, _a1) and can be further processed like for
      output:

      echo "a0 = $_a0"
      echo "a1 = $_a1"
      echo "Chi-square: $_ChiSq"
      echo "Correlation coefficient: $_CorC"
      echo "RMS per cent error: $_RMS"
      echo "Theil U coefficent: $_TheilU"
